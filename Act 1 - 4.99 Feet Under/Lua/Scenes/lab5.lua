How\n  are you not questioning this?","* Pichu: Uh, well, this is actually\n  pretty close to some stuff I've\n  seen in neko religious texts...","* Ben: Ha, reading? What a nerd.\n* I thought you weren't religious,\n  Pichu?","* Pichu: Hey, that doesn't mean I\n  can't be interested in these\n  sorts of things!","* Pichu: Especially cuz my dad\n  wouldn't shut up about them.","* Seb: What did the books say,\n  Pichu?","* Pichu: According to legend, nekos\n  are descendants of an ancient\n  race of beings known as Astrals.","* Pichu: Wielding powerful magic,\n  the Astrals became architects\n  of the universe.","* Pichu: They brought numerous\n  creatures into existence,\n  including humans.","* Seb: Huh, interesting.\n* Did you learn anything about\n  how Astrals fought?","* Pichu: What do you mean?","* Seb: Since I got here, every time\n  I've gotten into a fight my\n  surroundings get all trippy.","* Seb: And this floating red heart\n  shows up?\n* It's really freaking me out.","* Pichu: In order to employ their\n  magic in battle, Astrals must\n  cross over","* into an alternate plane\n  called the Bullet Channel.","* Pichu: I personally don't see why\n  a separate channel is needed for\n  that, but whatever.","* Pichu: As for that floating\n  red heart...","* Pichu: ...","* Ben: What's wrong, Pichu?","* Pichu: The SOUL is an important\n  part of neko spirituality...","* Pichu: It represents the\n  culmination of one's\n  being.","* Pichu: The color of your SOUL is\n  said to connect to your primary\n  personality trait.","* Seb: So what trait is red?","* Pichu: A red SOUL is something\n  truly special...\n* A SOUL of DISCORD.","* Pichu: Symbolizing a desire for\n  apathetic chaos, it holds the\n  power to rewrite fate itself.","* Pichu: It was so powerful that\n  the Astrals banished all SOULs\n  of DISCORD from this world.","* Pichu: That's what the legends\n  say, at least.","* Seb: Well, they're clearly wrong!\n* We just saw a 'banished power'\n  with our own eyes!","* Ben: To think we have such\n  a power on our side...\n* That's pretty awesome.","* Seb: So, uh...\n* You guys doing anything\n  after this?","* Pichu: Not much we CAN do...\n  Our homes were overrun by those\n  freaky Rees zombies.","* Ben: We have to find Mr. Lefler.\n  He wouldn't lead us astray-\n  He must be in here somewhere.","* Ben: And if GabeCorp is truly\n  behind all this, then I'd like\n  to get some answers from them.","* Seb: Sounds cool.\n* Time to explore!","* Seb: Oh, Ben, do you want your\n  hammer back?
