            <p>
                This section details functions Unitale adds to your Lua scripts to interact with the game in various
                ways. All functions will have a suffix in square brackets to denote in which scripts they may be used.<br>
                See <span class="ref">How to read this documentation</span> for more details.
            </p>

            <hr>
            <h4>All-script functions</h4><br>

            <p>
                <span class="function">DEBUG(<span class="string"></span> text) [E/M/P/W]</span>
                Write text to the debug console (toggleable with <span class="term">F9</span>). It will appear automatically the first time you
                write text to it. You can use this to check values in your code, or make sure some pieces of code are
                actually running.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <span class="function">SetGlobal(<span class="string"></span> your_variable_name, value) [E/M/P/W]</span>
                OUTDATED, as you can set variables in the Encounter script, which can be accessed from anywhere.
                <br><br>Sets a global variable. After setting, you can retrieve it from all your scripts at any time with
                <span class="term">GetGlobal(variable_name)</span>.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <span class="function">GetGlobal(<span class="string"></span> your_variable_name) returns variable [E/M/P/W]</span>
                OUTDATED, as you can set variables in the Encounter script, which can be accessed from anywhere.
                <br><br>Gets a Global Variable that you previously set using <span class="term">SetGlobal()</span>.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> SetRealGlobal(<span class="string"></span> your_variable_name, value) [E/M/P/W]</span>
                Sets a Global variable that is accessible even in the overworld. After setting it, you can retrieve it from all of
                your scripts at any time with <span class="term">GetRealGlobal(variable_name)</span>.<br>
                Persists through battles, but not between sessions. These variables can be saved using the overworld save system.<br>
                Can be used in the overworld.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> GetRealGlobal(<span class="string"></span> your_variable_name) returns variable [E/M/P/W]</span>
                Gets a Global that you previously set using <span class="term">SetRealGlobal()</span>.<br>
                Can be used in the overworld.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> SetAlMightyGlobal(<span class="string"></span> your_variable_name, value) [E/M/P/W]</span>
                <i>AlMighty Globals</i> are globals that are instantly saved into a file when set: these globals persist
                through sessions, even in modDev mode, and can't be removed.<br>
                However, you can use the <span class="term">Remove AlMighty Globals</span> button in modDev to remove them.<br>
                Can be used in the overworld.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> GetAlMightyGlobal(<span class="string"></span> your_variable_name) returns variable [E/M/P/W]</span>
                Gets an AlMighty Global that you previously set using <span class="term">SetAlMightyGlobal()</span>.<br>
                Can be used in the overworld.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> SetFrameBasedMovement(<span class="boolean"></span> bool) [E/M/P/W]</span>
                Set to <span class="term">true</span> if you want frame-based player movement (2px/frame) instead of time based player movement (120px/s).
                <br>Set it to <span class="term">false</span> if you already are in frame-based movement and you want to go back to the time based movement.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> SetPPCollision(<span class="boolean"></span> bool) [E/M/P/W]</span>
                Setting this to true will force all bullets that don't have a specified collision type to use the Pixel-Perfect collision system.
                If you want to use it, then I'd highly recommend seeing <span class="ref">The Pixel-Perfect Collision System</span>.
                <br>False by default.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <span class="function">BattleDialog(<span class="luatable"><span class="string"></span></span> list_of_strings) [E/M/P/W]</span>
                This makes the list of strings you give to the function appear in the UI dialog box. After skipping through
                them, you will automatically go to the monster dialogue step by default. Below is a working example of
                how you could use it for a Vegetoid encounter.
            </p><br>
            <div class="code-container">
   <pre class="brush: lua;">function HandleCustomCommand(command)
    if command == "DINNER" then
        if ate_greens then -- ate_greens is a non-default variable, of course
            currentdialogue = {"Ate\nYour\nGreens"}
        else
            currentdialogue = {"Eat\nYour\nGreens"}
        end
        BattleDialog({"You pat your stomach.\nVegetoid offers a healthy meal."})
    end
end
</pre>
                <p>(For the Lua specialists; it is indeed a table of strings rather than a list of strings.)</p><br>
            </div>

            <p>
                <span class="function">State(<span class="string"></span> state_to_go_to, <span class="CYK"></span> arguments...) [E/M/P/W]</span>
                A powerful function that immediately skips the battle to the specified state, rather than following the
                default conventions. Below is a list of valid strings you can pass to it, what state you'll be going to
                and what that state entails. The states you pass to it are case-invariant, but uppercase is recommended
                for readability.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <span class="CYK"></span> State may also need several other arguments to determine some data related to
                the states it tries to go to. This data allows the engine to specify which Player is choosing an action,
                or to specify which part of a state we are in.
                <br><br>
                Here is a list of states CYK can enter and what complementary arguments it needs in order to switch to
                the selected state correctly:
            </p><br>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="term">INTRO</span> - This is the first state CYK is in. It hides the main UI of the
                    battle and the TP bar, and plays the <span class="term">"Intro"</span> animation of all the Players.
                    The state <span class="term">ACTIONSELECT</span> is entered once all of the Players' animations are done.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">ACTIONSELECT</span> - While in this state, you can select FIGHT/ACT/ITEM/SPARE/DEFEND
                    for the current Player.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="CYK"></span> Needs the id of the Player as argument #1. Must be a number between 1
                    and the max number of players.
                    <br><br>
                    <font color="#fff">* If you're not sure, this is the position of the player in <span class="term">players</span>,
                    or the value of <span class="term">Entity.ID</span>.</font>
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">ENEMYSELECT</span> - This state displays a list of all active enemies in the
                    encounter. This state gets entered automatically after choosing FIGHT, ACT or SPARE.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="CYK"></span> Needs the id of the Player as a argument #1 (same as <span class="term">ACTIONSELECT</span>).<br>
                    Also needs a a string as argument #2:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="term">"FIGHT"</span> - Acts the same as manually choosing the FIGHT button.</li><br>
                        <li><span class="term">"ACT"</span> - Acts the same as manually choosing the ACT button.<br>
                        Will throw an error if this Player doesn't have an ability named "Act".</li><br>
                        <li><span class="term">"SPELL"</span> - Acts the same as choosing a target for a spell. Will throw an error if
                            this Player has an ability named "Act".<br><br>
                        Needs a third parameter which is the name of the spell this Player will use as a string.</li><br>
                        <li><span class="term">"ITEM"</span> - Acts the same as choosing the target for an item.<br>
                        Will throw an error if this item is supposed to target all the Players or all the enemies.</li><br>
                        <li><span class="term">"SPARE"</span> - Acts the same as manually choosing the SPARE button.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">ACTMENU</span> - This state displays all of the options from the selected enemy's
                    <span class="term">commands</span> in order if the current Player has an ability named "Act",
                    otherwise it will display the different spells of the Player.<br><br>
                    <span class="CYK"></span> Needs the id of the Player as argument #1 (same as <span class="term">ACTIONSELECT</span>).<br>
                    Also needs the id of the Enemy as argument #2. Must be a number between 1 and the max number of enemies.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">ITEMMENU</span> - This state shows all of the player's available items. It's tied
                    with the <span class="term">HandleItem</span> function (see <span class="ref">Game events</span> for
                    more information).
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="CYK"></span> Needs the id of the Player as argument #1 (same as <span class="term">ACTIONSELECT</span>).
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="CYK"></span> <span class="term">PLAYERTURN</span> - This is the state where all of
                    the Players' actions are executed, one after the other. Entered when the last Player's action is
                    selected.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">ATTACKING</span> - Starting this state will put you in the screen where you either
                    deal damage to an enemy by pressing "Z" at the right time, or you wait and miss entirely, for each
                    Player who selected the FIGHT button.
                    <br><br>
                    The enemies each Player attacks is the same as the enemy selected during their own turn in the state
                    <span class="term">ENEMYSELECT</span>. After this state ends, the encounter moves on to the
                    <span class="term">ENEMYDIALOGUE</span> state by default.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">ENEMYDIALOGUE</span> - When starting this state, <span class="term">
                    currentdialogue</span> gets read from the Encounter script for every monster and their dialogue is
                    displayed. If that doesn't exist, it'll return something at random from the <span class="term">
                    randomdialogue</span> list.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">DEFENDING</span> - When starting this state, <span class="term">nextwaves</span> is
                    read out from the Encounter script and all scripts in the Waves folder with matching names will be part
                    of this defense step. <span class="term">wavetimer</span> is also read from the Encounter script at this
                    time.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="CYK"></span> <span class="term">BEFOREDONE</span> - This is the state that is entered
                    whenever there are no more active enemies. It displays the Players' <span class="term">"EndBattle"</span>
                    animation and the amount of D$ and EXP they won. This state can't be exited as long as there are no
                    active enemies.
                </li><br>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Finally, there are two "special" states that evoke behavior in the engine itself:
            </p><br>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="term">DONE</span> - Changing state to <span class="term">DONE</span> will instantly force
                    the player to the mod selection screen.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">NONE</span> - This state does nothing. It is entered for the first frame of the
                    encounter, but entering it manually will completely freeze your encounter. It might be useful if you want
                    to disable all of Unitale/CYF's basic functionality.
                </li><br>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> Freezing states</span>
                As of CYF v0.6.2.1, calling <span class="term">State("PAUSE")</span> will perfectly "pause" an encounter. The last active state will remain active, but in a frozen state, until you call <span class="term">State</span> again.
                <br><br>

                        <b>as well as players used in multi-commands</b>.</li><br>
                    <li><span class="term">PrepareFight</span> - Started when a Player has selected a Fight command, but is waiting.</li><br>

                    If you guys want me to split the Spare animation and the Act animation, I can do so, you just have to say it and it'll be done in the next release.<br></li>
