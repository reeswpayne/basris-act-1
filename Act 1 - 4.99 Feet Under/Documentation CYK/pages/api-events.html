            <h2>Game events</h2><br><br>
            <p>
                This section is all about game events. Game events are functions in your scripts that the Unitale engine
                runs at various points in the game. By changing up your behaviour depending on the actions the player
                takes, you can go beyond a basic encounter and make it great.
            </p>

            <hr>
            <h3>Encounter script events</h3>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">EncounterStarting()</span>
                Happens once when everything's done initializing but before any encounter actions start. You should do
                things like stopping the music here, or using <span class="term">State()</span> if you want to start the fight off with some
                dialogue.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">EnemyDialogueStarting()</span>
                Happens when you go to the monster dialogue state. You're still free to modify monster dialogue here.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">EnemyDialogueEnding()</span>
                Happens when you go from the monster dialogue state to the defending state.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">DefenseEnding()</span>
                Happens when you go from the defending state of the game to any other state. If you read up on the
                <span class="term">RandomEncounterText()</span> function, you'll want to use it here.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">HandleSpare()</span>
                Happens when you select the Spare option from the Mercy menu, regardless of whether a monster is
                spareable or not. This event fires <i>after</i> the sparing of monsters is completed. If you spare the
                last enemy in the encounter, this function will not happen - the encounter is over at that point.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">HandleItem(<span class="string"></span> item_ID, <span class="number"></span> position)</span>
                Happens when you select an item from the item menu. <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="term">item_ID</span>: The name of the item used, converted to all-caps.
                    Similar to <span class="term">HandleCustomCommand</span> in monster scripts.</li>
                    <li><span class="term">position</span>: The position of the item used in the player's inventory. The first item is number 1.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><span class="CYF"></span> In CYF, you can use the Inventory object to edit the player's inventory.
                The items' names will be in caps, like with <span class="term">HandleCustomCommand()</span>.
                <div class="code-container">
  <pre class="brush:lua;">function HandleItem(ItemID, position)
    if ItemID == "DOGTEST2" then
        BattleDialog({"You selected The Second Dog.", "You are truly great."})
    else
        BattleDialog({"You didn't select The Second Dog.", "You could've picked better."})
    end
    DEBUG("You chose item #" .. position .. " in your inventory.")
end
</pre>
            </div>
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">EnteringState(<span class="string"></span> newstate, <span class="string"></span>  oldstate)</span>
                A new, more flexible way of handling state changes. When you enter a new state, this function will fire
                with <span class="term">newstate</span> containing the new state's name, and <span class="term">oldstate</span> containing the previous
                state's name. Both are in all caps. One of the most powerful things about it is that you can use <span class="term">State()</span>
                here to interrupt state changes initiated by the engine itself.
                <br><br>
                <span class="CYK"></span> Calling <span class="term">State</span> from within this function will
                call <span class="term">EnteringState</span> again!
                <br><br>
                <br>Possible states and when they execute are below:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="term">ACTIONSELECT</span>- Returning to the main part of the battle, where you can select
                    FIGHT/ACT/ITEM/MERCY.
                </li>
                <li><span class="term">ATTACKING</span>- When the Players are attacking the enemies.</li>
                <li><span class="term">DEFENDING</span>- When the enemy/enemies finish dialogue, and one or more waves start.</li>
                <li><span class="term">ENEMYSELECT</span>- When you've selected either FIGHT or ACT, and need to select an enemy.</li>
                <li><span class="term">ACTMENU</span>- When you've selected an ACT target, and must now select an ACT command.<br>
                    <span class="CYK"></span>This is also the state used when a Player is selecting a SPELL to cast.</li>
                <li><span class="term">ITEMMENU</span>- When you've selected ITEM.</li>
                <li><span class="term">MERCYMENU</span>- When you've selected MERCY.</li>
                <li><span class="term">ENEMYDIALOGUE</span>- When your enemy/enemies start their dialogue.</li>
                <li><span class="CYK"></span><span class="term">PLAYERTURN</span>- When you execute all of the Players' actions. Entered when the last Player's action is selected.</li>
            </ul>
            Note: There are three states not mentioned here - because they never occur naturally. You can find them in <span class="ref">Functions &amp; objects</span>.
            <br><br>For a clearer example, here's a code snippet replicating the older events above.
            <div class="code-container">
<pre class="brush:lua;">function EnteringState(newstate, oldstate)
    if newstate == "ENEMYDIALOGUE" then
        --same as EnemyDialogueStarting()
    elseif newstate ~= "ENEMYDIALOGUE" and oldstate == "ENEMYDIALOGUE" then
        --same as EnemyDialogueEnding(). Alternatively, check for newstate == "DEFENDING"
    elseif newstate ~= "DEFENDING" and oldstate == "DEFENDING" then
        --same as DefenseEnding()
    end
end
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Update()</span>
                This function runs for every frame for all of the encounter, even during waves. For advanced users: the
                Update function is required to exist at the beginning of the encounter. If you define it at a later
                point in time, it will not get executed.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function"> <span class="CYK"></span>OnGameOver()</span>
                This function runs the instant the last living player dies.<br>
                But this event works differently than the others.
                <br><br>
                By adding <span class="term">return false</span>, you can <b>prevent the game over sequence from
                starting</b> and replace it with your own code!
                <br><br>
                <b style="color:#ffffff">NOTE</b>: If you plan to use <span class="term">BattleDialog</span> in this
                event, you MUST call <span class="term">State("NONE")</span> first!
                <br><br>
                <h5 style="color:#ff0000; line-height:20px">WARNING: Be careful when using <span class="term">return false</span> to
                run your own code.<br>
                CYK is designed to work with living, active players. You may encounter errors and problems outside
                of <span class="term">ENEMYDIALOGUE</span> and <span class="term">NONE</span>!
                <br><br>
                ALSO NOTE that killing the players again will <b>trigger this event a second time!</b></h5>
            </p>

            <h3><span class="CYK"></span> Entity script events</h3>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYK"></span>Update()</span>
                This function runs for every frame for all of the encounter, even during waves. For advanced users: the
                Update function is required to exist at the beginning of the encounter. If you define it at a later
                point in time, it will not get executed. This function is triggered after the Encounter's Update function.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">HandleAttack(<span class="CYK"></span> <span class="entity"></span> attacker,
                <span class="number"></span> damage)</span>
                Happens the moment the entity is damaged - this is when you hear the hitting sound and when the
                hp loss text appears.<br>
                <span class="term">damage</span> will be -1 if the attack dealt no damage. The entity's
                <span class="term">hp</span> variable will have updated at this time, too.
                <br><br>
                <span class="CYK"></span><span class="term">attacker</span> is the entity which is currently attacking
                this entity.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span>BeforeDamageCalculation(<span class="CYK"></span> <span
                class="entity"></span> attacker, <span class="CYK"></span> <span class="number"></span> damageCoeff)</span>
                Happens before the damage calculation after pressing Z when attacking. You can easily use
                <span class="term">SetDamage()</span> in this function and lots of other animations and such.
                <br><br>
                <span class="CYK"></span><span class="term">attacker</span> - Entity attacking this entity. Monsters can attack Players.<br>
                <span class="CYK"></span><span class="term">damageCoeff</span> - Strength of the attack depending on how close the attack cursor is
                to the square target. Value between 0 and 1, 0 being "Miss" and 1 being a perfect attack.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYK"></span>HandleAnimationChange(<span class="string"></span> newAnim)</span>
                This function runs every time this entity's animation is changed through <span class="term">SetCYKAnimation()</span>.
                <br><br>
                From inside this function, use <span class="term">return false</span> to prevent <span class="term">newAnim</span> from starting.
                <br><br>
                If you want to "replace" an animation with another, you must do this:

                <div class="code-container">
  <pre class="brush:lua;">function HandleAnimationChange(newAnim)
    if newAnim == "Idle" and canspare then
        SetCYKAnimation("Spareable")
        return false
    end
end
</pre>
            </div>
                <font style="color:#fff;text-decoration:underline">NOTE:</font> Calling <span class="term">SetCYKAnimation</span> from inside
                this function will call <span class="term">HandleAnimationChange</span> again! Code responsibly, avoid infinite loops.
            </p>

            <hr>
            <h3>Player script events</h3>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYK"></span> HandleCustomSpell(<span class="entity"></span> target,
                <span class="string"></span> spell)</span>
                Happens at the beginning of this Player's turn, in the state <span class="term">PLAYERTURN</span>, if the Player
                selected a MAGIC command during their action choice. This function is used to handle this Player's available SPELL
                commands (also called <span class="term">abilities</span>).
                <br><br>
                This works much like <span class="term">HandleCustomCommand()</span> except the spell doesn't have to be capitalized.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYK"></span>UpdateTurn()</span>
                Happens in the state <span class="term">PLAYERTURN</span>, if it is currently this Player's turn and
                <span class="term">WaitBeforeNextPlayerTurn()</span> has been called for this player.
                <br><br>
                Use <span class="term">EndPlayerTurn()</span> to end the turn, and go to the next Player's turn, or
                have the enemies start attacking.
            </p>

            <hr>
            <h3>Monster script events</h3>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">OnDeath()</span>
                Happens after your attack's shaking animation has completed and the monster's HP is 0. If you implement
                <span class="term">OnDeath()</span>, your monster will not die automatically, and you will have to do
                it manually with the <span class="term">Kill()</span> function. OnDeath() will only happen through
                monster kills that happened with the FIGHT command; scripted <span class="term">Kill()</span> calls
                will not trigger it.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span>OnSpare()</span>
                Happens after you successfully spared a monster. If you implement <span class="term">OnSpare()</span>,
                your monster will not be spared automatically, and you will have to do it manually with the
                <span class="term">Spare()</span> function. <span class="term">OnSpare()</span> will only happen through
                a monster spare that happened with the SPARE command - scripted <span class="term">Spare()</span> calls
                will not trigger it.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">HandleCustomCommand(<span class="string"></span> actcommand)</span>
                Happens when you select an Act command on this monster. <span class="term">actcommand</span> will be the
                same as how you defined it in the <span class="term">commands</span> list, except it will be <b><u>IN ALL
                CAPS</u></b>. Intermediate example below, showing how you can use it and spice it up a little.
            </p>

            <h3>Wave script events</h3>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Update()</span>
                This function is called every frame (usually at 60FPS) while monsters are attacking (the defense step).
                <br><br>
                That's pretty much it. Update your bullets here - more on bullet creation and control is on the
                <span class="ref">API - Projectile Management</span> page.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span>EndingWave()</span>
                This function is called just before the wave ends. It allows you to easily reset some variables and other such things.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">OnHit(<span class="userdata">bullet</span> bullet)</span>
                Every time a bullet collides with a player, this function gets called from the script that created the
                projectile. The bullet object in this function can be modified if you feel like it. For more information
                on the bullet object, see the section <span class="ref">Projectile Management</span>.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you implement this function in your script, you have to manually define what should happen after
                bullet collision. This is what allows you to create orange, cyan and green projectiles, and much much
                more. If you don't implement this function in your wave script, it'll stick to the default of dealing 3
                damage on hit.
                <br><br>
                <h4><span class="CYK"></span> IMPORTANT!</h4>
                Instead of using
                <span class="term">Player.Hurt()</span> or <span class="term">Player.Heal()</span> to change the
                Player's HP, you need to return two values:<br>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="number"></span> OR <span class="string"></span>: The amount of damage to deal.<br>
                    If this number is negative, the player will be healed instead of hurt.
                    <br><br>
                    As a number: This will set the amount of damage the target player takes.<br>
                    As a string: This will use Deltarune's damage formula to calculate the damage you take.<br>
                    <span class="term">"100%"</span> means 100% of the calculated damage, <span class="term">"200%"</span>
                    means 200%, <span class="term">"50%"</span> means 50%, and so on.
                    <br><br>
                    You can also use negative values such as <span class="term">"-50%"</span>.</li><br>
                    <li>Optional <span class="number"></span>: The amount of seconds of invincibility.<br>
                    This is 1.7 by default, but if your bullet deals a negative amount of damage (heals the player),
                    this number will be 0.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                Here are some examples:
                <br><br>
                <div class="code-container">
  <pre class="brush:lua;">function OnHit(bullet)
    return 3, 2.5 -- equal to Player.Hurt(3, 2.5) in CYF
    return 1, 0   -- equal to Player.Hurt(1, 0)   in CYF
    return -10    -- equal to Player.Heal(10)     in CYF
    return "100%" -- default value, uses enemy's ATK and player's DEF to calculate damage
    return "50%"   -- only take 50% of calculated damage
end
</pre>

            </p>
